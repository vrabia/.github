### Vrabia App - the social experience you didn't know you needed

Vrabia's purpose is to engage its users in meaningful music-based social interactions. Using a social and safe environment to express one's musical taste, people can find friends with similar interests regarding the music they are listening to on a daily basis.


Vrabia can be used by lone wolves that only want to store a history of their musical preferences, or by social butterflies desiring to share their experiences with the world. It guides you toward possible future friendships with people you share at least one passion with - the music you both listen to, and it shows you the undiscovered side of the genres you usually enjoy, but didn't take the time to explore.
